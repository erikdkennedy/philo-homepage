                <h1>Front-End Software Engineer</h1>
                <h2>Our story</h2>
                <p>Philo is a young San Francisco-based startup building the future of television — letting you watch your favorite shows on all the devices you care about with intelligent search, insightful discovery, and effortless sharing. Philo’s leadership consists of founding team members from Facebook and Meraki, and brings deep industry experience to the team. Philo is backed by NEA and HBO, among others.</p>
                <h3>Necessity is the mother of invention</h3>
                <p>Philo was born in a Harvard dorm room, where cable TV wasn’t offered and the over-the-air broadcast couldn’t penetrate the walls of the 300-year-old brick residence halls. The founders of Philo wanted to watch TV around campus, so they wrapped their room in aluminum foil to boost the signal, and connected it to a server to stream it over the campus network.</p>
                <h3>We’ve moved from aluminum foil to silicon</h3>
                <p>Our technology may have changed, but our mission is the same. At Philo, we are building the TV experience we wanted for ourselves. Today, hundreds of thousands of students can use Philo to watch all the live and recorded television they love on all of their favorite devices, and that’s just the beginning.</p>
                <h3>Company and Culture</h3>
                <p>We’re a small team that puts our product experience first. We foster a flexible work environment that is supportive but allows for autonomy so that everyone on the team can help us build towards our vision. Philo engineers own what they build from start to finish. We ship to production multiple times per day and keep unnecessary process to a minimum so we can maintain our pace of rapid development. We value pragmatism, having pride in our work, and deep transparency at all levels.</p>
                <h2>Where you fit in</h2>
                <h3>Hack the Full Stack</h3>
                <p>Philo’s engineers hack up and down the technology stack. It’s not uncommon for a Philo engineer to go from backend coding to user experience design, from the video encoding pipeline to system scalability, from site maintenance to iOS/Android development.</p>
                <p>We are actively hiring engineers who are looking to build a completely new kind of product and who have a passion for back-end, firmware, or front-end development. All engineering positions are open to both recent college grads and experienced engineers / Ph.D.’s.</p>
                <h3>Qualifications</h3>
                <p>The Product Team is responsible for designing, building, testing, and quite literally reinventing television, the most engaging product ever created, across web, mobile, and TV platforms. Just as television is about more than simply watching an episode of your favorite show, so too does our work extend well beyond the play button. We take TV schedules, movie and show metadata, live and on-demand feeds, recordings, real-time localized usage metrics, cross-device interoperability, and individualized viewing habits, preferences, restrictions, and notifications – massaging it all into a comprehensive and seamless TV experience. We are positioned at the forefront of both web TV and front-end development technologies, building on DRM-decrypting HTML5 video along with a modern workflow leveraging React and ES6.</p>
                <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Iteratively designing and improving upon our video players, application UIs, and cross-device interoperability.</li>
                    <li>Architecting real-time data syncing across clients and servers.<br>
                    Prototyping, testing, and iterating upon new features.</li>
                    <li>Improving and incorporating cross-platform metrics to continually measure engagement and usage patterns</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Requirements</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Developing in plain JavaScript</li>
                    <li>Building and maintaining large scale single page applications</li>
                    <li>Working in a codebase with multiple contributors</li>
                </ul>
